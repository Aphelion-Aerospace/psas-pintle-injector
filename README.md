The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is seeking to launch a liquid bi-propellant rocket to a height of 100 km. One of the principal challenges in this endeavor is the development and testing of the rocket engine and associated subsystems. 


PSAS chose to develop a smaller scale, 2.2kN test engine prior to attempting a 100 km capable design. This is in keeping with PSASâ€™s technology development philosophy of iterative design where initial designs are built, tested, broken, and iterated towards fully functional and flight ready designs. 


The 2.2kN engine was designed to employ a liquid oxygen (LOX) centered pintle. In this design, LOX flows through the center of the pintle and is sprayed outward in a radial pattern. The fuel enters a chamber surrounding the base of the pintle and flows into the engine through the annular gap between the outer diameter of the pintle and the engine. (See Figures 1 & 2) Inside of the combustion chamber, the two propellants impinge upon each other at right angles. This, ideally, results in a cone shaped spray of well mixed fuel and oxidizer.

The choice to use this style of injector was finalized by the 2015-2016 capstone team who designed the 2.2kN engine. The use of a pintle type injector is not specifically required for this size of engine. That stated, the initial 2.2kN engine was designed specifically to work with a pintle type injector, which locked a number of the design parameters which may have otherwise been available. The most noteworthy restrictions imposed are that the injector can only be LOX centered, and has a maximum envelope for the outer diameter of the annular gap.
