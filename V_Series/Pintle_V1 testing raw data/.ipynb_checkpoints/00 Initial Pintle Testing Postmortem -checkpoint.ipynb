    "# Pintle Design:\n",
    " \n",
    " The engine was designed to employ a liquid oxygen (LOX) centered pintle design. In this design, LOX flows through the center of the pintle and is sprayed outward in a radial pattern. The fuel enters a chamber surrounding the base of the pintle and enters the engine through the annular gap between the outer radius of the pintle and the engine. (See Figures 1 & 2) Inside of the combustion chamber, the two propellants impinge upon each other at right angles. This, ideally, results in a cone shaped spray of well mixed fuel and oxidizer. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Damaged turbine flow meter\n",
    "\n",
    "When inspected, it was determined that debris had gotten into the flow meter and damaged the turbine. Root cause is believed to be mis-use due to lack of adequate documentation on proper use, maintenance, and storage the flow meter. The turbine flow meter was located just downstream of the globe valve for the tests performed on 1/19 and was removed prior to the the tests performed on 1/26.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Orifice flow meter set up\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue with our orifice plate set up was that we had difficulty locating an orifice plate which could measure the flow rates we require in a 0.5 inch tube. The closest found was from [O'Keefe Controls](http://catalog.okeefecontrols.com/item/precision-metal-orifices-npt-connections/precision-metal-orifices-npt-adapter/h-125-br) with a flow rate of 3.096 gpm of water at 70 psi. This orifice was modified based on sizing calculations provided by the manufacturer with the intention to test the orifice across the expected flow ranges to determine the correct orifice $C_v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, larger, issue is in where the pressure transducers were located relative to the orifice. The pressure transducers were placed as close to the orifice plate as our fittings would allow, rather than at one of the standard distances called out in various flow measurement references. At the time the orifice meter was constructed it was believed that we could compensate for the placement of the pressure transducers via calibration. \n",

As we did not have a replacement on hand, we proceeded with the tests with the understanding that there would be some water flow and pressure loss through the LOX circuit when testing the Fuel circuit. This valve was replaced prior to the testing performed on 1/26 with a properly functioning globe valve.\n",

    "## Loose wire connection between DAQ and pressure transducers\n",
    "\n",
    "When calibrating our pressure transducers on 1/26, we found a loose wire which was producing a high level of noise. Once properly secured our pressure transducer readings became significantly less scattered. When comparing the collected data between 1/19 and subsequent testing dates it became obvious that the data collected from 1/19 was affected by this, or a similar issue. This issue potentially also affected the original orifice flow rate data (shown in Figure 4 above), which was not realized until after testing was completed. \n",
