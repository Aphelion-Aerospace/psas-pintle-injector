    "A new design for is needed for the flow path into the fuel chamber. V3 should employ 3 entrances radially spaced $120^\\circ$ apart. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it would be possible to perform spray testing with this design, the spray angle would most likely be highly eccentric. It was decided to rapidly push for a V3 design which could be 3D printed at 3D systems using the MJP process. "
