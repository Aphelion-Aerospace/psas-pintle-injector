    "\n",
    "The pintle injector needs to meet the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Oxidizer: Liquid Oxygen (LOX)\n",
    "2. Fuel: 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, 30% water (IPA)\n",
    "3. Meet mass flow rates at a pressure differential between 15-25 % of chamber pressure: \n",
    "    - Engine chamber pressure 350 psi (as designed)\n",
    "    - Target pressure differential: 53-88 psi   \n",
    "4. LOX mass flow rate of 0.9 lbm/s (0.4082 kg/s)\n",
    "5. Fuel mass flow rate of 1.16 lbm/s (0.5262 kg/s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional physical size and machining constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Max outer diameter for Annulus, 0.55 in (13.97 mm)\n",
    "2. Min Pintle wall thickness 0.08 in (2.032 mm)\n",

    "# Design considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The flow paths need to be increased in size for both the Pintle and Annulus. Both underperformed and will need larger orifices. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The test jig used for the Pintle V1 needs to be redesigned. The V1 design only contains 1 flow path to the fuel chamber behind the annulus, while the actual engine contains 3. The current dimensions of the singular flow path (0.126\"$\\emptyset$) are such that it introduces sizable pressure losses which will not be present in the actual engine.\n",
    " - The diameter of the flow path into the fuel chamber needs to be increased to 0.25\"$\\emptyset$ which more closely resembles the actual geometry.\n",

    "- Pintle Geometry\n",

    "### Getting Started\n",
    "When approaching the redesign of the pintle, it was noticed that the thickness of the inner diameter and wall thickness of the pintle comprise the Pintle OD. This dimension sets the lower limit on size for the annulus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The logical sequence for determining the design is to first determine a feasible geometry for the pintle (LOX flow path), and then determine the needed Annulus OD orifice size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining the Pintle dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard drill size chart was used to determine the range of easily manufactured sizes for both the inner diameter for the pintle and the exit orifices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting several drill sizes larger than those used for the V1 pintle, possible inner and exit diameters were entered into the design tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "The design tool used the given inputs along with estimated loss coefficients to determine the approximate pressure drop. For more information on the equations used in these calculations see [V1-01 Pintle Flow Calculations and Analysis](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/blob/master/Pintle/Pintle%20Injector%20Design%20Documentation/V1-01%20Pintle%20Flow%20Calculations%20and%20Analysis.ipynb) which can be found in the Pintle injector design documentation folder of the Liquid-Engine-Test-Stand repo on PSAS's Github page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining the Annulus dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "Having determined the potential Pintle ID, the Pintle OD was calculated by from $2t_w * P_{ID}$ where $t_w$ is the pintle wall thickness and $P_{ID}$ is the pintle ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the relatively small size of the Pintle, standard drill sizes were used as inputs for the Annulus OD. The first drill size checked was one size larger than the Pintle OD. consecutively larger drill sizes were tried until the calculated pressure loss dropped into the desired range.\n",

    "# Validation of the design\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry found using the Pintle Design Tool was used to create a CFD model using Star CCM+.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFD model used the same mass flow requirements and geometry as was used to determine the V2 pintle geometry. The pressure loss found in the CFD analysis were found to be within 2 psi of the Pintle Design Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one potential issue noted with the design during the CFD analysis was uneven exit velocity (Fig 2). \n",
