    "The propellant injector is one of the critical components of a rocket engine. If the injector incorrectly designed, the best you can hope for is poor performance. At worst, you may be building another test stand from the ground up. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of different injector types. Each of which perform the same core functions of metering the propellants into the engine at the correct flow rate and mixing them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) has elected to pursue the development of a pintle type injector for its initial fray into liquid propellant rocketry. This notebook is intended to serve as a crash course in the theory, design, manufacture, testing and lessons learned during the 2018-2019 school year.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is seeking to launch a liquid bi-propellant rocket to a height of 100 km. One of the principal challenges in this endeavor is the development and testing of the rocket engine and associated subsystems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PSAS chose to develop a smaller scale, 2.2kN test engine prior to attempting a 100 km capable design. This is in keeping with PSAS’s technology development philosophy of iterative design where initial designs are built, tested, broken, and iterated towards fully functional and flight ready designs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2.2kN engine was designed to employ a liquid oxygen (LOX) centered pintle. In this design, LOX flows through the center of the pintle and is sprayed outward in a radial pattern. The fuel enters a chamber surrounding the base of the pintle and flows into the engine through the annular gap between the outer diameter of the pintle and the engine. (See Figures 1 & 2) Inside of the combustion chamber, the two propellants impinge upon each other at right angles. This, ideally, results in a cone shaped spray of well mixed fuel and oxidizer. \n",

    "The choice to use this style of injector was finalized by the 2015-2016 capstone team who designed the 2.2kN engine. The use of a pintle type injector is not specifically required for this size of engine. That stated, the initial 2.2kN engine was designed specifically to work with a pintle type injector, which locked a number of the design parameters which may have otherwise been available. The most noteworthy restrictions imposed are that the injector can only be LOX centered, and has a maximum envelope for the outer diameter of the annular gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the design considerations which led to choosing a pintle were:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combustion Stability:** According to multiple references [cite][cite] pintle type injectors have a higher combustion stability than other types of injectors. This reduces the risk that the injector will create unstable combustion which can lead to an engine failure.\n",

    "**Throttling:** Pintle type injectors can be designed such that they can be throttled. Throttling offers some potential future advantages for a 100 km engine. Going with a pintle design from the start, in theory, should make the leap throttling easier. \n",

    "## Operational Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The pintle injector serves two primary purposes in the engine. First, it delivers the fuel and the oxidizer to the combustion chamber at the correct mass flow rate and pressure. Secondly it mixes the propellants and promotes proper combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the mass flow rate through the injector is controlled by the input pressure for the fuel and oxidizer upstream of the injector. Ideally, the injector will have a pressure drop of between 15 and 25 % of the engine's chamber pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"This [pressure] drop isolates chamber-pressure oscilations from the feed system, reducing pressure coupling between the combustion chamber and the feed system which could lead to instabilities or oscillations in the flow that are driven by variations in combustion.\" [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "For pintle injectors, this pressure drop can potentially go as low as 5% [1]. Until PSAS has built some heritage with our pintle designs, it is recommended that the 15-25% range be aimed for. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to some of the available research on pintle injectors, the optimum propellant spray angle is $45^\\circ$.[2] In theory, this spray angle is achieved when the momentums of the two impinging fluids are equal. See Figure 3.  \n",

    "The governing equations employed for the first approximations in this design were:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass flow rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass flow rate for each propellant is one of the critical design parameters for any rocket engine. Thus it is a critical parameter for the injector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass flow rate is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\dot{m} = \\rho VA\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Elevation Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in elevation between one side of the injector and the other is small enough as to have no measurable effect with the instrumentation being used. Even if this were not the case, the elevation difference is small enough as to have make no practical difference to the calculation results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic pressure required to increase the fluid velocity from rest (in the tank) to the entrance velocity into the injector is relatively small compared to the other pressures involved. For the 2.2kN design it was on the order of 10-20 kPa (2-3 psi). This term is being neglected for the first pass approximation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Determining the loss coefficients for the was one of the first challenges to be overcome in designing a pintle type injector. \n",

    "\n",
    "The idea was that each flow path within the injector has multiple changes to flow area between point of measurement and the atmosphere. The early hand calculations in this project attempted to approximated the overall loss coefficient by segregating the internal flow geometry into segments which could examined individually for pressure losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of those pressure losses could then be added together to determine a total pressure drop estimate, $\\Delta P$. This $\\Delta P$ could then be used along with the mass flow rate to estimate a total $K_L$ for the injector. This showed early promise with the V2 injector and gave pressure drops which agreed with CFD models and physical testing. When attempts were made to scale up the injector design to meet the general requirements of an engine capable of reaching 100km, the errors in the estimate quickly diverged from CFD models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A note of caution, hand calculations and CFD should be employed during the design phase, but any injector which is to be used in an engine needs be specifically tested to determine its loss coefficients and spray angle performance. Small variations in hole sizes due to manufacturing defects, burs, etc, can effect the actual performance of an injector. Theoretical models are valuable to steer the design into the right neighborhood, but still require physical testing for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additional issue, the loss coefficients for this design don't scale linearly with regard to the exit areas. This is especially true for the radial orifices of the pintle. Generally the wall thickness of the pintle is not increased at the same scale as the exit orifices. As the exit area and mass flow rates are scaled for a larger engine, flow separation in the corners begins to reduce the effective exit area. This separation can be seen in Figure 7. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Exit Velocity\n",

    "#### Concentricity\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring that the pintle is correctly centered in the annulus is particularly important. Even small amounts of concentricity error can lead to uneven exit velocity, a lopsided spray angle, and less than optimum combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exit orifices\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pintle is to employ circular orifices, the as-built dimensions should be measured using gauge pins. The As-built dimensions should thereafter be used during testing and evaluation of the design. This includes re-running any hand calculations with the exact exit areas measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "For the annular gap found in the V series design, some success was had using gauge pins at multiple locations around the pintle to determine both concentricity and the exact gap distance. There may be better, more accurate ways to do this which should be looked into if at all possible.\n",

    "### Machined Aluminum\n",

    "### 3D printed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plastics\n",
    "\n",
    "Most 3D printed plastics which were available on campus at the time of this writing are not suitable for water testing injectors. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Using a Formlabs could potentially work if you oversize the entrance holes and epoxy in threaded hardware. You will need to pay close attention to the dimensional accuracy. You should pay special attention to checking the the circularity of the pintle and the concentricity of the annulus. If the pintle is not printed vertically, it can come out slightly lop sided. The same goes for the annulus. This can pose an issue for trapped liquid in this type of resin printer. Careful designing would need to take place in order to get it to work, and all dimensions would need to be measured and verified, preferably with gauge pins and micrometers.\n",

For instance, it may be possible to find some commercial off the shelf (COTS) part(s) which could modified to serve as a portion of the injector. This could greatly speed up the manufacturing of test articles. It also could potentially lower the development costs.\n",

The injector is going to be subjected to liquid oxygen, high temperature combustion products, and relatively high pressure. The tip of the pintle is exposed to extreme heating which can potentially damage the pintle and make it a single use item. Thought should be put into how to either make the pintle tip easily replaced between tests, or how to keep it from getting too hot, preferably both.\n",

    "The metal for the pintle needs to be LOX compatible: Generally this means 304 or 316 Stainless steel, with 304 having a slightly higher melting temperature. There are other material options as well such as Inconel (1390-1424$^\\circ$C), Nickel, Copper, or Nickel-Copper Alloys.  \n",

The solution to this was to split the flow into the fuel chamber into three, radially spaced flow paths.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The first attempt to explore an injector design within the approximate flow range of which may be needed by LV4 yielded results that were frustrating and initially confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first attempt sought to scale up the V3 2.2kN injector on the naive assumption that the loss coefficients and exit velocities would scale in a predictable enough fashion to be able to roughly calculate the correct size based upon the physical testing and CFD results for the 2.2kN injectors. This assumption was incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, both the loss coefficients and the exit velocities did not behave as originally assumed.  This prompted a series of full factorial experiments using CFD, where key dimensions and parameters were systematically adjusted to isolate the key parameters that affect the loss coefficients for this design. The results of the experiments were then used to create a set of piecewise curve fit equations that can be used to obtain a good estimate of the loss coefficients for any size injector between the V1 2.2kN injector with approximately 0.2 kg/s total propellant mass flow rate, up to an injector with over 2.5 kg/s total propellant mass flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was while doing this analysis and experimenting that it became apparent that the original pintle design will not work for a 6 or 8 kN engine without some modifications to address the issues created by flow separation in the radial orifices.\n",

However, the exit velocity of the fluid actually increased from 12 m/s to nearly 14 m/s. As can be seen in Figure 7, the modified design is does not seem to fix the flow separation issue. The momentum ratio is also negatively impacted by this increase in exit velocity of the denser fluid, which also has a higher mass flow rate requirement.   \n",
