One of the critical steps prior to hot firing the motor is the testing and validating of the propellant injector. For this motor, a pintle style injector was selected and an aluminum test article was machined according to the designs provided by the 2015 Capstone team.  \n",

    "The 2015 engine was designed to employ a liquid oxygen (LOX) centered pintle design. In this design, LOX flows through the center of the pintle and is sprayed outward in a radial pattern. The fuel enters a chamber surrounding the base of the pintle and enters the engine through the annular gap between the outer radius of the pintle and the engine. (See Figures 1 & 2) Inside of the combustion chamber, the two propellants impinge upon each other at right angles. This, ideally, results in a cone shaped spray of well mixed fuel and oxidizer. \n",

    "\n",
    "The pintle injector serves two primary purposes in the engine. First, it delivers the fuel and the oxidizer to the combustion chamber at the correct mass flow rate and pressure. Secondly it mixes the propellants and promotes proper combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the mass flow rate through the injector is controlled by the input pressure for the fuel and oxidizer upstream of the injector. Ideally, the injector will have a pressure drop of between 15 and 25 % of the engine's chamber pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    ">This drop isolates chamber-pressure oscilations from the feed system, reducing pressure coupling between the combustion chamber and the feed system which could lead to instabilities or oscillations in the flow that are driven by various in combustion. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "For pintle injectors, this pressure drop can potentially go as low as 5% [1]. Until PSAS has built some heritage with our pintle designs, it is recommended that the 15-25% range be aimed for. \n",

    "\n",
    "Determining the loss coefficients for the a pintle style injector was one of the first challenges to be overcome in designing an injector which met both the mass flow rate and pressure requirements of PSAS's first rocket engine.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea was that each flow path within the injector has multiple changes to flow area between point of measurement and the atmosphere. The early hand calculations in this project attempted to approximated the overall loss coefficient by segregating the internal flow geometry into segments which could examined individually for pressure losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of those pressure losses could then be added together to determine a total pressure drop estimate, $\\Delta P$. This $\\Delta P$ could then be used along with the mass flow rate to estimate a total $K_L$ for the injector. This showed early promise with the V2 injector and gave pressure drops which agreed with CFD models and physical testing. When attempts were made to scale up the injector design to meet the general requirements of an engine capable of reaching 100km, the errors in the estimate quickly diverged from CFD models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A note of caution, hand calculations and CFD should be employed during the design phase, but any injector which is to be used in an engine needs be specifically tested to determine its loss coefficients and spray angle performance. Small variations in hole sizes, even when within tolerance, can effect the actual performance of an injector. Theoretical models are valuable to steer the design into the right neighborhood, but still require physical testing for validation.\n",

    "This is especially true when exploring a new injector design, or a design which has been altered to obtain a different mass flow rate or mixture ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a manufacturing challenge due to the material and required tolerances which are needed to manufacture an injector. During the design phase, attention should be given to finding ways to produce dimensionally accurate, lower cost, prototypes which can be made, tested, and iterated upon **quickly**.\n",

    "The fast, low the cost of the prototypes allow for faster development of a functioning injector design which will meet an engines requirements.\n",

    "Pintle injectors have certain dimensions which require very high precision in order to function properly. \n",

    "Ensuring that the pintle is correctly centered in the annulus is particularly important. Even small amounts of concentricity error can lead to uneven exit velocity, a lopsided spray angle, and less than optimum combustion.\n",

    "#### Plastics\n",

    "Most 3D printed plastics which were available on campus at the time of this writing are not suitable for water testing injectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The closest type of 3D print to being workable was done with on a Formlabs printer.\n",

    "\n",
    "It could potentially work if you oversize the entrance holes and epoxy in threaded hardware. You will need to pay close attention to the dimensional accuracy. Specifically the circularity of the pintle and the concentricity of the annulus. If the pintle is not printed vertically, it can come out slightly lop sided. The same goes for the annulus. This can pose an issue for trapped liquid in this type of resin printer. Careful designing would need to take place in order to get it to work, and all dimensions would need to be measured and verified, preferably with gauge pins and micrometers.\n",
    "\n",

For instance, it may be possible to find some commercial off the shelf (COTS) part(s) which could modified to serve as a portion of the injector. This could greatly speed up the manufacturing of test articles.\n",

    "## Final injector\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major concern for the final version of an injector is material selection. The injector is going to be subjected to both liquid oxygen, high temperature combustion products, and several hundred PSI. The tip of the pintle is exposed to extreme heating which can potentially damage the pintle and make it a single use item. Thought should be put into how to either make the pintle tip easily replaced between tests, or how to keep it from getting too hot, preferably both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metal for the pintle needs to be LOX compatible: Generally this means 304 or 316 Stainless steel, with 304 having a slightly higher melting temperature. There are other material options as well such as Inconel (1390-1424$^\\circ$C), Nickel, Copper, or Nickel-Copper Alloys.  \n",

    "This design met the flow rate requirements. It was not tested for spray angle because there was visibly uneven flow through the annulus. The cause of this was suspected to be flow separation in the fuel chamber which did not have adequate time to fully develop inside of the annulus. The solution to this was to split the flow into the fuel chamber into three, radially spaced flow paths.  \n",

    "The first attempt to explore an injector design within the approximate flow range of which may be needed by LV4 yielded interesting results. By interesting I mean frustrating and initially confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first attempt sought to scale up the V3 2.2kN injector on the naive assumption that the loss coefficients and exit velocities would scale in a predictable enough fashion to be able to roughly calculate the correct size based upon the physical testing and CFD results for the 2.2kN injectors. This assumption was incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, both the loss coefficients and the exit velocities did not behave as originally assumed.  This prompted a series of full factorial experiments using CFD, where key dimensions and parameters were systematically adjusted to isolate the key parameters which affect the loss coefficients for this design. The results of the experiments were then used to create a set of piecewise curve fit equations that can be used to obtain a good estimate of the loss coefficients for any size injector between the V1 2.2kN injector with approximately 0.2 kg/s total propellant mass flow rate, up to an injector with over 2.5 kg/s total propellant mass flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was while doing this analysis and experimenting that it became apparent that the original pintle design will not work for a 6 or 8 kN engine without some modifications to address the issues created by flow separation in the radial orifices.\n",

    "\n",
    "The addition of an inverted cone shape to the inside of the pintle tip reduced the pressure drop in the CFD model from 180 psi down to 100 psi for the same 1.5 kg/s flow rate. However, the exit velocity of the fluid actually increased from 12 m/s to nearly 14 m/s. As can be seen in Figure 7, the modified design is does not seem to fix the flow separation issue. The momentum ratio is also negatively impacted by this increase in exit velocity of the denser fluid, which also has a higher mass flow rate requirement.   \n",

    "While it may be possible to get this design to work, it creates makes obtaining the optimum momentum ratio challenging at best. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Add more holes\n",
    "Add a second row of orifices for the pintle. The secondary orifices should be offset from the initial row of orifices. This could increase the blockage factor and increase the overall exit area for the pintle. \n",
